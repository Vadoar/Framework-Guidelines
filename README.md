Vadoar 5WH Framework
Communication Flow Protocol for Blockchain Token Holders
 
The vision for VADOAR is to create a community based standard for ICOs.
The VADOAR 5WH Framework and its related guidance notes, products and services were created to provide a foundation for standardizing the information and practices related to blockchain community building token projects (ICOs).
Many of the ICOs that have launched, and raised significant funds, have been little more than a website and a whitepaper.  Most have only a vague roadmap of their plan going forward.  The majority have no budget, no milestones and lack simple language communication describing the project and the proposed use of funds raised from the community.
If ICO Projects continue this way, it will not end well.  There will be projects that fail.  Token holders will lose the value they contributed to the project.  Some of these failures will be the tried and failed kind, but others will be the “took the money and ran kind”.  And when, yes when, that happens, the fall out may overshadow the promising potential of blockchain applications.  
If you are planning an ICO, you need to read this document. 
Community participation expresses support for your Project.  Support your community by providing a level of information about the Project that will allow community members to make an informed decision about whether to become and remain a member of your Project community.  
If you have questions, or need help to create your ICO documentation, reach out to us. 
 
A Step-by-Step ICO Communication Guide
There are X stages common to every token project, starting from the idea and progressing through a team working to make the idea a reality.
The VADOAR 5WH Framework covers the following token Project stages:
Initiation
Planning
Pre-Launch
Launch Announcement
Launch
Post Launch
Execution
Milestone Achievement
Between Milestones
 

Pre-Initiation - VADOAR 5WH Pre-requisite
Most blockchain projects begin with a white paper outlining the technical elements of the project.  To maximize the potential of building your token holder community, your project needs a business case and a project plan.
What is a business case?
A business case explores the reasons for your project and the benefits your project will provide.
For example, the business case for a Token wallet, would describe what a Token wallet does and why people need one.  It would include a description of tokens, how people currently store tokens, why that isn’t satisfactory and the benefits of storing tokens in a wallet.
Your project doesn’t need to be a business to need a business case.  For example, if you’re working on part of the blockchain infrastructure, such as an oracle, you can still create a business case by describing why your project is necessary and what benefits it will provide.
 
A project plan is a step by step plan for building the token wallet.  Each step includes the tasks that need to be completed, and an estimate of the amount of time and resources needed to complete each step.
These documents, combined with your white paper, will be used to create the VADOAR 5WH Communication Flow Protocol for Blockchain Token Holders.
Initiation
The initiation phase begins with the decision to raise funds to develop the project.
There are two parts to the initiation phase:  Token Model and Introduction.
Token Model
The project’s token model describes the role played by tokens in the project model.  This memo by Smith + Crown provides examples of the different token models.
The number of tokens and any value ascribed to the tokens may not be final at this stage.
Introduction
In addition to creating the Whitepaper, website and social channel presence, the project will also create a VADOAR 5WH Project Introduction.
Elements of the VADOAR 5WH Project Introduction are set out below:
Who?
Who is the team?  Include a brief biography of each team member and their role(s) in the Project.
What have they done before?
Have they worked together before?
What?
Provide a description of the project in simple language.  As if you were explaining it to your Mom (assuming your Mom is not a blockchain developer). 
What will the Project do?
What are the risks associated with the Project?
Why
Why is the Project important? 
Why is now the time to start the Project ?
Why is your team the group to develop the Project?
Where
Where is project based?
When
When will you start the Project?
What are the milestones along the way?
What will you have/do when the Project is complete?
Pre-Launch
You’re in the Pre-Launch stage when the Business Case, Project Plan, White Paper, Website and Introduction are complete.
From these documents you will prepare the ICO Terms and Conditions.  The ICO Terms will include:
A detailed description of the Project and the Project team
A detailed description of how your token economy or ecosystem works
Milestones and Money
Respect
Project Description
At this stage of your project you are preparing to share your idea with a much broader audience.  Some of the people interested in your project may not have deep knowledge of the blockchain space, so it is important to describe your project simply.  Test your project on non-techie friends and family.
At this stage you should also start crafting your pitch – a single sentence that describes what your project does and why that matters.  This sounds like a simple task, but it usually takes several iterations to get it right.    You’re aiming for a short, engaging answer to the question “what are you working on?” that you can give to a potential community member.
In your project plan, you created a budget and schedule for your project.  For simplicity and communication purposes, the budget should be created in fiat currency.  Now is the time to convert the budget to the base cryptocurrency you plan to use, Bitcoin or Ether, and start working out your token model.   If you anticipate a high level of interest in your project, it is important to think about how you will satisfy that interest.   If you are undecided about your token model, look at what other projects in the space are doing and see what may work for your project.  
From this process you will be able to create a description of the rights/privileges attached to your community tokens.  Model these rights/privileges so you can see how the ideas work in practice.  This modelling will be different for every token project.  For example, if you plan to offer your token holders the right to join you on a weekly Q&A session, what will you do if all token holders decide to join the session.
The last step in the token modelling process is to decide how your community will get their hands on your tokens.  Simplicity is the most important part of the process and you need to get it right.    The instructions for sending Bitcoin/Ether to your project should be so simple that an alien from Pluto could follow the process, even if she knows nothing about the blockchain.
 It is also useful to look at the community reaction to different token offerings.  A negative reaction 
Milestones and Money is a table showing the Project’s community how you will spend the funds contributed by the community.  The table includes Project milestones and the cost associated with achieving that milestone.
Your Terms and Conditions document should include a description of each milestone as well as reference to a contingency plan if the Project  does not or cannot achieve a milestone.
Respect.  Community participation expresses support for your Project.  Support your community by  providing regular updates on your Project’s progress.  Include in your Terms and Conditions an outline of how your Communication Strategy.  A solid Communication Strategy is set out under Post Launch below.
Other Terms and Conditions best practices include:
Appoint a Project Manager to manage your Project post-funding.  You and your founding team may have project management experience, but  once your project is funded you will be fully occupied with your role as founder.
Provide a detailed Fund Management Plan.  Consider a multi-sig escrow contract, where funds are advanced to the Project against achievement of Project Milestones
Contract with service providers who can assist your team to run the Project, including Administration, Stakeholder Communication and Marketing.
The VADOAR 5WH Process team (described below) can assist your Project to implement these and other best practices.
Launch Announcement
 
Launch
You’re at the Launch stage when the count down clock has been added to your website.  The Terms and Conditions Document is complete, your tokens are priced and the funding contract is ready.
The Launch is a critical element of your Project.  A botched Launch will taint even the most promising Project.
Depending on the interest of your Project’s community, the Launch could be a very hectic time for your Project.  If Project interest is high, your Launch could be over in a matter of minutes.  If this is likely, you may want to consider how you will ensure broad access to your Launch.
Make it as simple as possible for your community to support your Project.  
How do Project community members acquire tokens, including cost per token.
FAQs about the acquisition process
How will your team respond to questions and concerns from the community during the launch period.
If something goes wrong with the launch, how will you remedy the problem.
How will you communicate with your community during the Launch.
Post Launch
Immediately after the Launch,  is the time to thank the Community for its support and remind the Community what they are supporting.
Add a summary of the Project,  including the Milestones and Money table to the Website.
This is also a good time to restate your Communications Plan.  Remind the Community how you will be communicating with them, where and when.
You may also want to remind your Community of the steps your Project has taken to ensure the funding they have provided to your Project will be used wisely.  This is a good time to announce the appointment of your Project Manager, Admin, Stakeholder Communication and Marketing Team.
Using the VADOAR 5WH framework your Communication Strategy will include:
Who
Who is the Project’s principal contact?
What
 
Where
Where will information about the Project be posted – Blog, Reddit, Medium, Website, Twitter Github…?
When
When will you update the Community?  
Why
Why you have you chosen the specific reporting intervals and reporting sources
